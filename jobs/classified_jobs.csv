Our mission is to meaningfully connect people so they can create, build, and grow together and as part of the team you can build how productivity tools should work 5\-10 years into the future. You will work with model builders (Google DeepMind), work with exceptional leaders, and have the ability to impact billions of users across the world.

 \-
 **Partner directly with enterprise customers and design partners** 
 — conduct regular user research sessions (bi\-weekly\+ during active design phases), observe workflows at manufacturing facilities, and translate complex enterprise needs into elegant product experiences.
 



 \-
 **Drive designs from concept to shipped product** 
 — work embedded with engineering throughout the development cycle, provide detailed specs and design documentation, participate in sprint planning and standups, review implementation in staging, and ensure shipped features meet design standards.
 



 \-
 **Design and ship enterprise\-grade workflows** 
 — multi\-facility data management, role\-based permissions and admin controls, bulk operations, collaboration features, and reporting/analytics interfaces that serve both plant operators and executives.
 



 \-
 **Conduct usability testing and validation** 
 — run structured tests with customers and design partners, analyze feedback, and rapidly iterate based on what you learn—both pre\-launch and post\-launch.
 



 \-
 **Balance user needs with business goals** 
 — understand our product strategy, revenue targets, and customer expansion opportunities, and make smart tradeoffs between speed and polish.
 



 \-
 **Champion design thinking**

**What we’re looking for:** 




  





 \-
 **5\-10\+ years of product design experience** 
 — with significant time designing for B2B or enterprise SaaS products (bonus if you've worked on data\-heavy, workflow\-intensive, or multi\-tenant platforms).
 



 \-
 **Strong design intuition and craft** 
 — you have an eye for detail, understand visual hierarchy and interaction design principles, and can produce high\-quality designs that feel polished and professional.
 



 \-
 **Proven track record shipping products** 
 — you've worked closely with engineering teams to bring designs to life, understand how to write specs that engineers love, and know how to balance design vision with technical reality.
 



 \-
 **Deep customer empathy** 
 — you love spending time with users, asking great questions, uncovering unspoken needs, and turning observations into actionable insights.
 



 \-
 **End\-to\-end design skills** 
 — proficiency in modern design tools (Figma, Sketch, etc.), experience creating design systems that scale, and the ability to move fluidly between strategic thinking and detailed execution.
 



 \-
 **Comfort with complexity** 
 — our users are managing environmental data across facilities, navigating regulations, and coordinating across teams. You're energized (not overwhelmed) by solving hard, multi\-dimensional problems.
 



 \-
 **Excellent communication and collaboration** 
 — able to present designs and rationale clearly, incorporate feedback constructively, partner effectively with engineers and PMs, advocate for users while respecting technical constraints, and build trust with customers.
 



 \-
 **Startup mindset** 
 — ownership mentality, comfortable with ambiguity, willing to roll up your sleeves and do whatever it takes, and excited to define processes rather than inherit them.
 



 \-
 **Bonus** 
 — experience with technical/analytical users, environmental/sustainability software, construction/manufacturing industries, or designing AI\-powered features.
 



 \-\-\-
 



**Why Pathways?** 




  





 \-
 **You'll institutionalize design** 
 — building enterprise UX from the ground up, defining what great looks like, and shaping our product experience as we scale.
 



 \-
 **You'll work directly with customers who matter** 
 — our users are manufacturers decarbonizing the built environment. Your work will have direct climate impact at global scale.
 



 \-

 We’re looking for someone who gets a kick out of finding great designers and building a recruiting process from the ground up. You’ll help grow our Product Design org through major expansion, own full\-cycle recruiting from sourcing to offer, and partner closely with design leadership and stakeholders across the company.
   

  

**What You’ll Be Doing**
* Work directly with Product Design leaders and hiring managers to really understand what makes a great designer at our company, and where new roles fit into our design \& product roadmap
* Run full\-cycle recruiting for design hires, everything from building the pipeline to extending offers
* Take ownership of sourcing: build your own candidate pipelines, craft thoughtful outreach, and connect with designers even before they’re actively looking
* Build and evolve recruiting strategies that meet the speed and scale of our next “hypergrowth” phase. We don’t have a massive team, so flexibility and creativity matter
* Do market mapping and research on design talent to help us stay competitive and informed about where strong candidates hang out
* Keep our process running smoothly: track pipeline data, maintain candidate information, and surface insights and updates to internal stakeholders
* Help close candidates. Manage offers, negotiate, and ensure we bring on great people who feel excited to join
* Take initiative on projects that make recruiting better over time — whether that’s improvements to candidate experience, data tracking, or collaboration with design partners
* Build strong relationships internally (with design, product, engineering) and with candidates so we’re always putting our best foot forward


**Who We’re Looking For**
* 3\+ years recruiting or sourcing experience, ideally focused on Design, UX, or other technical roles at a fast\-growing tech company or startup
* Strong sourcing chops, experience conducting creative outreach, and building pipelines from scratch
* Real understanding of different design\-related profiles (e.g. Product Designer, UX Researcher, Design Systems) and what makes them successful
* You know how to tell a story about a role, the team, and what makes working here so unique


**Why this role matters**
 This is a high\-impact role: you’ll be the person who helps shape the future of our design org. Because we’re still small, the person in this role has a ton of ownership and visibility. You’ll directly influence who joins the team and how quickly we can grow.
   

  

**Benefits (for U.S.\-based Full\-time Employees)**
* 100% medical, dental \& vision insurance coverage for you
+ Partially covered for your dependents
+ One Medical annual membership

* 401k (including employer match on contributions made while employed by Ramp)
* Flexible PTO
* Fertility HRA (up to $5,000 per year)
* WFH stipend to support your home office needs
* Wellness stipend
* Parental Leave
* Relocation support to NYC or SF (as needed)
* Pet insurance


**Referral Instructions**
 If you are being referred for the role, please contact that person to apply on your behalf.
   

  

**Other Notices**
 Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

 Brellium's mission is a
 *big* 
 one – to improve the standard of care across the US healthcare system. We’ve built AI\-powered technology that helps healthcare providers deliver safer, higher\-quality care \- starting with the first real\-time medical review platform built to fix clinical and compliance risks before they impact patients.
   

  

 Each year, 1 in 20 people in the U.S. experiences a medical diagnostic or compliance\-related mistake. Most providers lack the time, staffing, and tools to mitigate these issues \- so they go unnoticed, impacting care quality and increasing clinical and financial risk.
   

  

 Brellium is building the AI\-powered platform that helps providers deliver safer, more consistent care by mitigating risk early and aligning patient visits with clinical best practices. Our goal is to give every provider in the U.S. the tools to deliver clinically excellent, data\-driven care \- at scale.
   

  

 Brellium was founded in 2021\. Since then, we’ve grown to serve over 250,000 providers across all 50 states who use Brellium to take better care of their patients and ensure data\-driven, compliant care. We’re a Series A company with over $16MM in funding from First Round Capital, Left Lane Capital, and Menlo Ventures.
   

  

**The Role**
 As Brellium’s founding Product Designer, you’ll define how provider teams experience our platform. You’ll figure out how to make sure critical quality and risk data is available to end users in ways that are clear, actionable, and intuitive. You’ll own the end\-to\-end design process — from research and wireframes to high\-fidelity mockups and design system stewardship — shaping workflows that help provider teams use data and AI to deliver safer, higher\-quality care.
   

  

 This isn’t a typical role. It’s an opportunity to bring clarity and usability to some of the most complex, high\-stakes challenges in healthcare.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Design end\-to\-end workflows that make complex data easy to use for provider teams.
* Build and maintain Brellium’s design system from scratch.
* Partner with product, engineering, sales, and growth to translate provider needs into intuitive, usable products.
* Use research, testing, and iteration to refine designs and improve usability.
* Balance simplicity and clarity while designing for high\-impact, data\-rich healthcare environments.


**What We’re Looking For**
* 3–6 years of product design experience with end\-to\-end ownership.
* A strong portfolio showing design of complex workflows or data\-heavy interfaces.
* Depth in UX flows, interaction design, and visual craft.
* Comfort working in a fast\-paced, ambiguous startup environment.
* Strong collaboration skills with engineers, product managers, and go\-to\-market teams.
* Ability to clearly explain design decisions to both technical and non\-technical stakeholders.


**Nice\-to\-Haves**
* Experience designing for healthcare, AI/ML, or other complex B2B/B2B2C domains.
* Familiarity with provider team workflows, such as quality, risk, or compliance.
* Experience running user research sessions directly with end users.


*We are committed to offering a comprehensive and competitive total rewards package, including robust health benefits, commuter benefits, and meaningful ownership opportunities through equity. Compensation decisions are made holistically, ensuring fairness and alignment with market benchmarks while recognizing individual contributions and potential.*
**Benefits Offered Include**
* 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan
* Equity Compensation
* Dinner Provided via DoorDash \& stocked kitchen for NY employees
* Medical, Dental, and Vision coverage
* HSA / FSA
* 11 paid holidays each year
* Unlimited PTO
* Training and professional development
* Hybrid Work Schedule (4 days onsite, 3 if located \> 1 hour away)


**What it means to be ""One of Us""**
*Bias to Action:* 
 Brellium teammates do not wait to make reversible decisions or seek unnecessary approval. We quickly decide and move forward. If the decision was incorrect, we quickly reverse it and move forward.
   

  

*Thinks for themselves:* 
 Brellium teammates do not take things at face value. We ask ""why"" until base truth is reached. If a better solution is present, Brellium teammates use it, regardless of status quo.
   

  

*Negative Maintenance:* 
 The opposite of high maintenance isn’t low maintenance \- it’s negative maintenance. Brellium teammates are poised under pressure, self\-motivated, self\-improving, self\-disciplined, self\-aware, and non\-defensive.
   

  

*Expect Excellence* 
 : We hold ourselves to exceptionally high and continuously rising standards. We strive for thoughtfulness in our decision making, and for speed and quality in our execution. We acknowledge trade\-offs and communicate proactively.
   

  

*Communicate with Clarity* 
 : Brellium teammates communicate concisely, directly, and purposefully. We optimize for ensuring our points are easily understood the first time.

 Traversal is the AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for the enterprise—already trusted by some of the largest companies in the world to troubleshoot, remediate, and even prevent the most complex production incidents. Our mission is to free engineers from endless firefighting and enable them to focus on creative, high\-impact work.
   

  

 Our roots remain deeply embedded in AI research, and we're channeling that scientific rigor and creativity into building the premier AI agent lab for the enterprise. Hence, what we're proudest of is assembling the most talented yet nicest group of individuals, including researchers from MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley, to world\-class engineers from industry: Citadel Securities, Cockroach Labs, Datadog, DE Shaw, ServiceNow, Glean, Perplexity, Pinecone, and more, to take on one of the hardest problems for AI to solve. Without the entire team, none of this would be possible.
   

  

**The Role**
 As a Product Designer at Traversal, you'll shape how users experience—and trust—our agentic AI platform. You'll design the workflows, interfaces, and patterns that turn powerful AI systems into intuitive, high\-leverage tools for engineers operating in high\-pressure environments.
   

  

 This is a rare opportunity to join during a formative stage. Our core AI systems are maturing, our user base is expanding, and design is becoming central to how we scale. You'll drive the evolution of our design language, help formalize our rituals and operations, and play a foundational role in elevating the quality of the entire product.
   

  

 You will work closely with engineering, AI research, and product leadership to translate complex, multimodal data and stochastic AI behavior into clear, actionable, usable experiences. If you thrive in highly technical environments, enjoy ambiguity, and want to define what AI\-native infrastructure products can feel like—we'd love to meet you.
   

  

**Responsibilities**

* Collaborate closely with engineering, product, and AI teams to turn powerful capabilities into intuitive interfaces

* Build and scale the Lattice Design System across surfaces and use cases
* Design and refine critical experiences such as the start page, Session Studio, long\-running workflows, and data\-exploration surfaces
* Balance usability with constraints and opportunities inherent to AI systems
* Translate large, multimodal datasets into clear visualizations and interactions
* Iterate rapidly based on user studies, customer feedback, and insights from internal teams
* Advocate for user clarity and shape product strategy through a strong, user\-centric lens
* Pilot new methods for helping Traversal design and build faster and more effectively


**Requirements**
* 4\+ years of experience in product design, or equivalent practical experience
* Strong visual, UI, and interaction design skills, with a portfolio demonstrating end\-to\-end work from concept through launch
* Experience designing complex workflows or platform\-level experiences, especially for technical or power users
* Ability to own ambiguous problem spaces and drive them to clear, user\-centered outcomes
* Experience collaborating closely with engineering, understanding technical constraints, and shipping in fast\-moving teams
* Proficiency with Figma, prototyping tools, and working within or contributing to design systems
* Comfortable working in a fast\-paced, collaborative environment (startup experience is a plus, not a requirement)
* BFA / MFA in Visual design, Creative design, Graphic design, Digital design or similar visual field


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with developer platforms, data\-heavy products, or enterprise SaaS
* Experience building or evolving design systems at scale
* Familiarity with AI\-powered or LLM\-driven products
* Exposure to observability tools, SRE workflows, or incident response environments
* Prior experience in an early\-stage startup (Seed–Series B)


**Compensation**
 We offer competitive compensation, startup equity, health insurance, and additional benefits. The U.S. base salary range for this full\-time, in\-person role in New York is $150,000–$300,000, plus equity and benefits. Our salary ranges are based on location, level, and role.

**Why You Should Join Us**
 We'll make sure you're fully supported with health insurance, a great tech setup, flexible time off, and plenty of in\-office snacks. We offer competitive salary and equity packages, and take thoughtful consideration with every hire on our small, high\-impact team.

 At EliseAI, we're improving the industries that matter most: housing and healthcare. Everyone needs a place to live and access to quality healthcare, yet both are often harder to secure than they should be.
   

  

 By integrating AI agents deeply into existing workflows, we make them more efficient, reduce costs, and improve the experience for everyone.
   

  

* Housing: We simplify how renters tour apartments, sign leases, submit maintenance requests, and stay connected with their property team—bringing everything they need for their home into one place.
* Healthcare: We make it easy to schedule appointments, complete intake forms, and we help patients communicate with providers, so everyone can focus on health instead of paperwork.


 With EliseAI, organizations reduce manual work, improve accessibility, and deliver a seamless experience across essential services. We recently raised a $250 million Series E round led by Andreessen Horowitz to accelerate this mission.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We’re hiring our first dedicated Frontend / Design Engineer to own the end\-to\-end user experience across our core products and marketing site. In this role, you’ll operate at the intersection of design and engineering, establishing and implementing the design system, shaping the visual language of the platform, and rebuilding key interfaces to drive greater consistency, clarity, and usability.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Partner closely with design, product, and engineering to develop, maintain, and evolve our design system, ensuring aesthetic cohesion and a scalable front\-end architecture
* Collaborate with PMs and engineers to align on requirements, feasibility, and sequencing, helping shape how features are built from concept through launch
* Document patterns, promote consistency, and drive adoption of shared systems across teams
* Own and define our process and approach to frontend development as the first design engineer, acting as a bridge between design intent and production code
* Translate Figma designs into pixel\-perfect, accessible, and performant interfaces with a focus on visual consistency and high\-quality user experience
* Design and implement thoughtful UI interactions and micro\-interactions that enhance clarity, feedback, and usability across the product
* Bring high\-quality interaction patterns to life, including transitions, states, and responsive behaviors that make the interface feel polished and intuitive
* Work closely with engineering to ensure components ship with the intended fidelity, reducing visual regressions and post\-launch polish work
* Refactor existing surfaces to implement the design system, improve usability, and unify the visual language across the product and marketing site
* Attract top\-tier talent to join our driven team


**Move at rocket speed, build something massive.**
 We’re scaling fast, solving real client problems with precision and ambition. Here, you own your impact; full autonomy, no micromanagement, no fluff.
   

  

 We hire the best, expect the best, and give you the masterclass of your career. It’s hard, it’s intense, and it’s the most rewarding work you’ll ever do. If you’re hungry, driven, and ready to build something massive, climb aboard.
   

  

**Requirements**
* 2\+ years of Javascript, Typescript, and React experience
* Startup mindset with a strong sense of ownership, urgency, and pragmatism
* Experience in a fast\-paced and frequent code deployment environment
* Strong understanding of interaction patterns, responsive layout systems, accessibility, usability principles, and visual design best practices
* Proficient in Figma
* Up\-to\-date on modern tools and developer workflows (Cursor, Vercel, etc.)
* Ability to solve complex problems independently with minimal guidance
* Willingness to work in person at our office 4\-5 days a week


**Bonus If You Have**
* Experience with advanced web animations and complex visual effects (three.js, webGL, anime.js, GSAP, etc.)
* Experience with mobile design systems


**Why Join**
 Growth and impact. It’s not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded (unicorn!) startup that’s scaling so fast. That means that instead of following a playbook, you’ll be writing it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You’ll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn’t when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.
   

  

**Benefits**
 In addition to the growth and impact you’ll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:
   

  

* Equity in the company
* Medical, Dental and Vision premiums covered at 100%
* Fully paid parental leave
* Commuter benefits
* 401k benefits
* Fitness \& home services stipend to cover part of your expenses so you can focus on what matters
* A collaborative in\-office environment with an open floor plan, fully stocked kitchen, and all meals covered in the office
* Unlimited vacation and paid holidays
* We'll cover relocation packages and make the move exciting, not painful!


**Job Compensation Range**
 The salary range for this role is $170,000 \- $200,000\. EliseAI offers a competitive total rewards package which includes base salary, equity, and a comprehensive benefits \& perks package. Exact compensation is determined based on a number of factors including experience, skill level, location and qualifications which are assessed during the interview process.

 Palantir builds the world’s leading software for data\-driven decisions and operations. By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.
   

  

**The Role**
 Palantir Foundry is an end\-to\-end platform for data\-driven decision\-making. We're transforming the way organizations securely integrate their data, so they can then build reliable, critical applications atop that unified foundation. Our customers use Foundry to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organizations. They can also build sophisticated, full\-fledged programs, such as common operating pictures, alert\-triaging inboxes, and resource allocation planning tools driven by rich\-ML models.
   

  

 As a Full Stack Engineer focused on application development in Foundry, you will be responsible for crafting the tools used by thousands of users to build the sophisticated applications that power their businesses. You will be architecting and developing interfaces, state management and access patterns to support data\-intensive workflows that are both powerful and approachable. You may spend one day interviewing users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself considering that customer context along with signal gathered from other customers in different industries, brainstorming approaches to handling intricate UX needs with your teammates.
   

  

 You’ll regularly be faced with sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, or work with other backend engineers in developing them together.
   

  

 We’re hiring engineers who are passionate about solving real\-world problems and empowering both developers and end\-users to work optimally. If you’re motivated to develop reliable, performant, and scalable systems, and to design robust APIs and primitives, this role offers the opportunity to make a significant impact on our products and the people who use them.
   

  

**Frontline**
 Foundry Software Engineers may be offered the opportunity to Frontline, an exclusive program unlike any other. This unique, short\-term assignment involves being embedded with customers, allowing you to work directly with users and gain firsthand insight into how our products are used and the challenges our customers face. Unlike traditional engineering roles, Frontline immerses you in complex, ambiguous problems, empowering you to deliver impactful solutions across some of the world’s most important industries and institutions.
   

  

 Some of our most successful products were built on the factory floor, addressing real\-world problems for the world's most important institutions. These products were developed by some of our most successful product engineers, who began their careers in roles aligned with Frontline responsibilities, gaining a deep understanding of both our technology and our customers.
   

  

 Frontliners operate across a broad spectrum of responsibilities, much like a startup CTO. They work in small teams to own the end\-to\-end execution of high\-stakes projects. This spectrum ranges from discussing architecture and building custom web apps to conducting workshops with users and strategizing with customer executives. No two days are alike, as each day is diverse and impactful. By witnessing how customers engage with Foundry and experiencing these pain points firsthand, you’ll gain unique insights that feed directly back into our development process, helping to refine and enhance our products. After your frontline rotation is complete, you will return to your regular role where you can apply the experience and understanding you’ve gained.
   

  

**Core Responsibilities**
* Working as part of a community of engineers building shared frontend tooling to enable teams across Foundry.
* Designing and building for high\-scale data intensive APIs (example).
* Developing interactive workflow UIs.
* Building products which aim to make technical concepts accessible for non\-technical users.
* Creating low\-code/no\-code WYSIWYG tools, which enable application builders within Foundry to build products for their users.


**Technologies We Use**
* Typescript, React, CSS Modules and GraphQL.
* Palantir maintains Blueprint, and open\-source component library, which you will use to build applications.
* A combination of open\-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.
* Industry\-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, GitHub, and CircleCI.
* Our build and deployment tooling is owned by an expert, dedicated and friendly frontend infrastructure team that you can collaborate directly with or contribute to, further enhancing our tooling.


**What We Value**
* Passion for improving user workflows and building user interfaces that enable users to tackle their problems, while still maintaining engineering quality.
* Ability to work collaboratively in teams of technical and non\-technical individuals and understand how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building.
* Skill and comfort working in a constantly evolving environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
* Experience brainstorming and iterating with product designers.
* Experience building high\-quality software in a fast\-paced CI/CD development environment.
* Proven ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.
* Ability to learn new technology and concepts, even without in\-depth experience.
* Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial, but not necessary.


**What We Require**
* 2\+ years of frontend software engineering experience.
* Strong frontend coding skills used to write clean, effective code, regardless of framework, and existing proficiency in JavaScript and understanding of how web technologies work.
* Familiarity with data structures, loading patterns, frontend frameworks, and other technical tools and concepts.
* Proficiency with programming languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, or similar languages.
* Strong written and verbal communication skills.


**Salary**
 The estimated salary range for this position is estimated to be $135,000 \- $200,000/year. Total compensation for this position may also include Restricted Stock units, sign\-on bonus and other potential future incentives.

 The Campaign Finance Board is a nonpartisan, independent city agency that empowers New Yorkers to have a greater impact on their elections. Our mission is to make local democracy more open, transparent, and equitable by removing barriers to participation.
   

  

 We make it easier for New Yorkers to vote, meaningfully support candidates for city office, and run for office themselves. NYC Votes, our voter engagement initiative, meets people where they are to share trustworthy election information and help New Yorkers make a plan to vote. We publish the citywide Voter Guide, which delivers information about candidates directly to voters’ doors. Our public matching funds program ensures small contributions can make a big difference, allowing regular people to run for office by relying on the support of other regular people, not just wealthy donors and special interests. And we lift the veil on how candidates raise and spend money, increasing transparency and accountability in local government.
   

  

 We believe that when every New Yorker is empowered to participate meaningfully in elections, candidates will better reflect the communities they serve, elected leaders will be more accountable to the public, and New Yorkers will have a democracy they can truly trust.
